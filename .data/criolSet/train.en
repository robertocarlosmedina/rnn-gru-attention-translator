Ya yesterday that boy had a birthday, he made me want to be there
Well, me too
But I was in São Pedro
But I went to see him yesterday
Yesterday I couldn't even talk to him very well, because I spent the day in a place without a network
Uh ok
I was doing school work
In fact, my life is just doing schoolwork
This is the life of a studnt
Then
The only moral I have is that I'm already finishing this cycle here
Faith in God my brother
Ya thank you
We all deserve to relax in a good place
Do you remember Bikini Beach?
One of the things I never forgot
Even more when you're one step ahead of me
I'm a few steps ahead, even
Kkkkk this is normal even kkk
That will be something unforgettable
Since this is already going on, there's no other way to end it
You and I have a lot of history to do in this world
Right
Just let the right time come
Well, of course, all in due time.
I'm here talking to Xia, boy she put my heart in a really good state

Where are we going on the 25th?
Do you have any good parties?
Or we will sit somewhere
On the 25th I'm still without plains, and maybe without money too kkkk
We got it, this is normal
Well, things are calm
Well, things are calm
We improvise here
You know we are masters in improvisation
That's why I tell you that we are abandoned, boy kkk

You don't think
I think so, my brother

brother, how are you?
I'm soft, and you brother?
I called you days ago but it went to the mailbox
Maybe it was a lack of network
I'm soft too
Yeah, I saw soon
Now, I'm staying more on that side and there's a lack of network
I'm soft too
I saw it soon, it's relaxed
What have you been saying boy?
I'm just waiting for Friday to arrive so I can take a week off and relax a little
so that would be a good thing
What are you planning to do?
I thought they were going to give us 15 days
I have no money, because I had an accident with my lens, because if it wasn't for it I would go to São Vicente
But the lens got damaged?
because it should be 15, for you to really come
I miss you
Yes, it fell one leg now I have to go get another
But when are you going to change it?
Well, the idea was to really relax and take a few turns with you, if you have the chance,
spend time with Vuca and Raff too
I already have the money
I'm just finishing some tests, maybe I'm going to Saturday or on Monday
I have time now boy
I leave work at 5, 6 hours
Well, even more
oh yes, good
These people gave us only a week to get us badly used to
kkk calm down, but at least you'll relax lol
Well, I'm really missing
Now I'm going to the eastern plateau to walk around a bit
boy, you have to take me there one day because things seem to go well there
Well, when you want, we'll just go brother
Is there x women?
There are some girls, but it's on the big holidays that you see them
So let's go on the big holidays kkk
do things in the woods
We'll go up to go walk around a bit
This would do us well kkk

I'm here to go lie down
You do well
Until tomorrow kisses there
We are together my brother
Nery, how are you my brother, is everything okay?
I'm here in them
I did only 3
Does this week have a project management mini test?
I think so
You called me, young man
It was to tell you that Rafael told you to enter Messenger
Can you send me a photo of the test that you had in hand that time?
Just like you had it there please
with correction?
Yes, possible?
So I'm waiting
See if it appears well
could you take it side by side to see if it gets closer please
Ok
See it
That number 2 of Group 2
one of those mechanisms is the socket, isn't it?
Wait I will see and tell you
Flow control also
Yah ok thanks
you are welcome
Sónia, the subject of the test is what?
There is no test tomorrow
Oh ok, that test of that day...
Are standardization parts part 1 and part 2
Will the slides from Lesson 5 come out on the test?
Is only 4 part 1 and 2
OK thank you
Ana don't forget
Wait I will send you the resolutions too
Okay, I'll send it to you in a few more minutes.
See if you see them well
it didn't
if you have Swag you can call me please
Wait a minute
I will resend them to you again
It's good this way?
Yah, better
See if you can send me Abel's too please
But they are many
Wait a minute
Neves said a similar exercise will come out in the test
Sónia? Can you take your PA notebook tomorrow, please?
Hi, I will take it yes
how are you?
good and you?
Tomorrow you explain to me the exercises that the teacher did that day
I'm fine too
thank you in advance
Be well then, don't forget
Ok is well
Sónia good morning
Could you bring me your notebook from Abel's discipline please, so I can copy some subjects there please
Take it today
I'll take it to you, yeah
good morning
good and you?
also, that study how is it going?
Sónia, are you sure the test will be for consultation?
Is the test today just calculation or has theoretical too?
All of them kkk
The teacher told us to take our materials
I hope you are right
now I don't know if he was talking about the machine and form, or the slides
This is what I really want to know
But I will take at least one form on a paper
if it is, I'll do it inside the room at the time of the test
Are you going to school today?
Hi, yes I will, there around 12 o'clock
can you send me photos of your notebook again please, since diodes
But like before you take the photos, you marks a number in your notebook in sequence of one in one so I can follow
My phone is not taking very good photos
yah ok
You didn't get them to take them yesterday
No, you can leave it already found a way
Sonia, can you go to school tomorrow morning? Like at 7:15.
Would you explain a few things to me please?
Yes I will try.
Please, go
Look, Rafa told you about something later
we have ideas to meet there in the square at 7:45
takes 150$00
We will do something
Yh I'll see
no, it's for you to go
Until then I will tell you something
It's almost 8 o'clock, don't you know?
I already told the boys no
Then when coming home is complicated
No, you take the bus before 10 am
No, stay for the next
Ok, okay then
good "night" to you
no we won't stay up late
only more or less until 22 hours
So you know
Happy New Year Late Kkk
How are you?
Is that code-by-the-mancarra business still standing?
if you have finished Paulo's work, could you please send it to me
so I can make the pdf
And add some things that I found interesting to put there
Wait a minute, I'm out of net
Ok already arrived
look he's good as he is
What I was going to put, you already have it there
Now I do the powerpoint or do you?
You can do it, I'm without Word
you can also make the cover, but it is not yet to send
Ok, it's good, I already sent you an email
The introduction goes as far as I have put the "etc"
That other is another sheet
But tomorrow I'll fix it up at school
Ok, that's good then
Rafa said if you could send me photos of your circuit notebook so I can send them to him
or we can arrange to take pictures to send them to him
I already sent them to him at Messenger
Can you send us that Packet thing by email?
Wait I will send it to you, but I will do it now
I already made the 3, correctly
Now I'm going to do the 4
1b still I didn't understand it
3b is missing
1b you did it already
And C is the one we did
Go to the email that I sent you and you will find some interesting things
I already did it
ok let me see
I'm already seeing the document
I will see the document tomorrow
yesterday I went to see the document
today i will see the document
4 I think I did it wrong, I did it as a discreet signal but it is continuous
Yah I realized this, I'm here trying to do it
Me too
but this exercise is very difficult, how are we going to do it
I still don't know, but soon I'll have an idea
well then hurry up
anything I will send you a picture
It is a line that is increasing exponentially
I think the teacher got that part wrong where he says it's a continuous signal
If it is continuous, we have to use those integral things to go and see the overlaps
yes, tomorrow we will put our doubts
because if the exercise is continuous, it gets easier
lol that's what this is, because I think if he was discreet he would be easier
but that's not even, now it's time to understand what the teacher wants
Hope he's not like Varela, we'll ask him tomorrow
also still nothing
I have more or less idea how it is
But I don't know how to write x1 functions as a function of x3
You're the same as I am, like I broke it down
But if we go to see x3 has something similar with the odd part of x1
tomorrow we discuss this problem better
Yah we will see if Raffaele has done it too
I am also doing a documentation and I will send the teacher only photos and nothing else, or I will scan my notebook and send
I could take some pictures and make a PDF file, I'm not with time to draw graphics
I'm going to scan my notebook, so it's better
Yah is also good idea
I won't go anymore, I'm waiting for guests
We couldn't and I think there's something wrong with number 4
Yes, because this will give some strange results
The exercise, you know you to solve it
Jojó and I did it, but I don't know if it is correct
I'm no longer there at school
The pencil, you can't lend it to me
I don't have a phone, send it by message
Sónia how is the name of the plaque, the white one?
Which plaque really?
and also that part where we turn on the source before turning on the plaque
Leave it without putting it on and on Monday we ask the intern
When you can send me photos of the frequency table that the teacher was doing there inside the class
I will organize it first and then I will send it to you
it's ok, thanks in advance
you are welcome
What I have so far, I will send you
Tomorrow I will send you to table
You are inspired, but calm down
Is delivery on Tuesday?
Tattoo of your choice and for free
good ideia, am!!!
I if I put that thing there that I know, I already know what they're going to put
I don't have anything anymore
See there and tell me something
Is your computer up to date?
I'm fine and you?
A little more, now I'm doing laundry
Have you seen him?
Not yet, but what I had sent it before.
I saw some things there that we're going to change order
How not, Sonia
I don't have internet, but as I trust you...
Okay then, partner
The work, on Monday we are going to see it, because we have to see what Rafael did and put them together
And Rui's also
see you tomorrow then
good study, even though you won't study until tomorrow night.
hahaha how you guessed haha...
I already "know" you when it comes to studying
Sónia you understand me, or not?
Clear
You already know how my brain works
At the last dawn before the test the performance is greater
really hard level... but tomorrow it's all or nothing
because I'm already here to study anything
Send me photos of exercise 4, please
This will go with bad quality due to my camera
Is Varela's class tomorrow at 8 am?
Yes, was it you who said that? Listen here, you left at that time and I kept your headphones
yah i noticed it, tomorrow i'll take it
ok, be ok...
the works to be done, how are they going? How are we going to make them? The ones from Matlab.
If you want we can make one tomorrow
And then we do the other
Did you make a PDF explaining what you did in the SS codes?Or you put them only in comments...
I'm making a PDF, and I'll also post some comments too
Could you send me the image of exercise number 3 please
Just a little more because I'm not home
Ok, when you get home, don't forget please
thank you in advance
And yes, I don't know what I would do without you my partner kkk
hahahah...
You would just play Call of Duty and program
But I don't have internet to be able to send them to you
Just choose the photos
It's ok
Do you have pictures of the other previous years?
if yes, please send them to me
They sent one in that room group
But send it to me, please and thank you
Then send me your exercises resolved
What do you think of tomorrow we will tell the teacher to clear up doubts about the conversion exercises tomorrow afternoon, or do you already understand them?
See a beauty... In fact a gift from God that Professor Emanuel Ribeiro gave us for the work of ESE
Tomorrow just do it, and the report too.
Right after the test is shit after shit
I need your conversion exercises
When is the next SD test?
I would like to know too?
Wait let me see, I'll tell you
I have marked SD and SS on the same day
Hm... lets go of things
That's why I'm asking you
We have to see, because if not
We are already fucked just like that, imagine
Remember the disc
I understand the laplace transform
and I alone in, just to see how far we've come
Hahaha... great advance
Do you understand the FFT?
Sónia we go in parts, one thing at a time hahaha...
If you come to understand it tomorrow you explain it to me
There is only work to deliver, he put them there as if it has any work to be delivered
Yes, that day I saw them and I was going to tell you that
I think he forgot and he put them like this
In Monday we will ask him, and nothing more...
For us not to end up doing shit
I already understood the DFT
Tomorrow we add ideas
Sónia, I would like you to tell me what we are going to study
Only the slide about modullation that the teacher send
And the exercises solved, and we have nothing more
You can leave me, I'm lost right here
But it's just what's matter that we had, but we're fucked up anyway
it's just you knowing the formulas...
I want you just discover me the 20 in the exercise I showed you today
Tomorrow you will explain me some things
If I know anything, no problem...
I am not understanding absolutely nothing...
The night is still new... hahaha...
Tomorrow you will explain me some things
Didn't you find out where the 20 came from?
no...
Take your record to school tomorrow
My charger is gone
Shit...
Yes. Devil... It immediately made me angry
I was going to end up doing some shit in the code that isn't working as it should... now it goes away.
Damn, try to fix it, immediately tomorrow
These days here you can't be without it
Sónia I am not able to open the report to send to Neves
The internet is shit.
The report, now tomorrow I'll see it in Paulo's class, and deliver it...
We'll hand in the work on Friday so the teacher doesn't show up with problems tomorrow.
agreed then
If the teacher says something important about the work you tell me
What test do we have on the 29th? And from where?
You can send me the first SS exercise you have solved
I'm not home now
When you arrive...
Something about communication..., now I'm not remembering
Sónia, the script?
Oh I forgot...
This is good haha...
Have you studied?
I'm on it
I'm worried about Emanuel's two jobs
Sónia when is the SD test?
I think it's the 9th
I found the SS exercise solution but only that it is in python and it is all resolved
I think Txoba and I had already found it
but relaxed, we got away with it, so I hope
I hope so
Is the game over yet? Can we go back upstairs?
And that's what we are doing
now I'm just going to do one more simple thing to earn more money with programming
Sónia, how are we already?
It's going well, but I would like you to explain to me what you did, and also what I would have to do, when we see each other.
Sónia tomorrow we don't have any test?
No, but we have a test on Friday, those of Emanuel.
I was already hurrying, it was on the 7th or 8th I think, but I don't know.
I'm not at home.
I don't know if Professor Emanuel will change them. Probably yes, he was left to send some solved exercises, but he hasn't said anything since
And tomorrow we don't even have it, to know if we have a test or not.
Roberto, tomorrow can we share Neves's work?
Yes, well thought out.
Ok, so you and Rafa divide it and it will make us easier.
Yes, tomorrow we will talk better then.
The test comes from digital modullation.
Sorry for answering just now, it's because my phone is gone.
I lost the audio.
I'm really fucked
I will study only the resolved exercises he gave
Where did he give them?
It is only one sheet
When did he put them?
I found a card and the lamp holder
Did you find them all?
I didn't see them, but then we're fine
I did not find lamp holder
Ok that we have to go buy one
The teacher will put more exercises resolved, he has put several now.
Ok, I'll see it now.
there are these and there are more of everything he has already sent
Sonia being honest these things are relaxed
after all we were given a lot
I've seen them, tomorrow I put them in the cabilas.
I hope they will serve you tomorrow.
the teacher has already given more new assignments to do SS, have you seen it?
He is really crazy, and he put the work there until the 18th
What should he be thinking? I haven't seen him yet. Almost he doesn't know we'll have a vacation.
He fell beautifully, Raffaele must be frustrated.
Roberto, are only 4 slides for the test?
From the first slide.
But are they only 4? So that's all.
So less documentation to do. But you were saying you had a 60 and I didn't see it, so I confused
I've done the post, and what is missing to do now?
The two puts, and you also have to change that thing I told you that time
We see here tomorrow or later, in fact tomorrow we have to see the work of the other discipline
Yes, that's right because we haven't done anything about the report yet and tomorrow Professor Neves will ask us about it
When I make these cablas I try to do anything
But in the report you know that me, you and Rafa if we get our hands on it, in less than 3 hours we will write it
I haven't studied yet, I'm just finishing up Paulo's work. Giving it at the end like SD work so I can relax and fully focus on others
Sonia, another work of Professor Emanuel.
Rui said about it, this is until when?
It is until the 17th
But at least the model already works, and this is already good
At Professor Neves I am already finishing the development, only the photo of simulating and the pseudocode is missing
Okay, I'm almost finishing mine
Rafa said he is working on his as he said. I'm here doing it but I just stop, because my head is hurting
It has to be because the semester is not over yet, almost at the end of the semester he wants to take me with him
Don't let it go, what do you mean...
We have x works to do
Then you can feel comfortable, you can tell the teacher to share the grade to you two
You haven't found anyone with Professor Paulo's test of the past years
What time will you go to school?
I go at 10 am and little, Rafa too
I have a headache still can't get up, if it's later I'll go
You rocked the project in...
Yes, we had 18 kkk
very good, I really liked it, and how much did you have in the test?
You had 18
11.2
I had 16.4
you are already clear
KKK a long time ago, you too
Now our life depends on Professor Emanuel
Yeah boy, he'll put them on the eve of the exam, just to screw up our lives
How are the percentages of work and tests in Paulo's discipline?
I already put them in the group, but you and I are already clear in it.
Now it's time to worry about other subjects
Tell him if he wants help to do the random
it would be the easiest thing, and much faster, I would write the code in 15 minutes, do feature tests in 5 minutes. And generate the values ​​in fractions of seconds.
He doesn't understand random, just Matlab and see hey, not much
but of Matlab he understands a lot
He understands a little to the point of knowing that we did shit in the work
Yes, a lot
But anyway, we will survive. We have to go with hope, after all our nation came from hope
Now is just wait...
Sónia talk to your friend and tell him to put the grades.
He must not even remember us
But there are SS tests already on Monday, he should see these things
In fact...
He will put the grades on Sunday
What is he thinking?
Someone has to send him an email, for him to give us a light
Who will be the sacrifice of this nation?
This now I don't know...
Did Professor Sidney call you?
We have to talk then lol
Leave a message in the group kkk
We could email you in the class email
and mail in the mail of sala!!! hahaha
Yes, then no one would be the sacrifice, ask the staff what their opinion is
I mean you have the idea to come and tell me to do it haha ​​..., you're the one who's crazy
Damn, they even put the list of candidates for the exam, and still our friend didn't put the grades
of course everyone does their part
Me, that guy takes us from serious
Now that you have arrived
And I start working on Monday
Yes, then someone else has to come and write the email
that guy should get rid of me so i can sort my life out
And what did Sidney tell you?
It was about what Paulo had told us, and he told me to pass there on Monday afternoon
Will they pay us, not?
Sidney spoke just to contribute and never spoke of price
He is just come to us
But I can give them a hand and that is always something to put in my documentation.
Has Emanuel already put anything?
He just said the first grade of SS's work and nothing else
And how did it go?
I had 15 in it, and how did you go?
I haven't seen it yet, did he put it in the Classroom?
Yh in the first practical work
I'll see you now
I even found it strange that I didn't tell me anything wrong too
Calm, there is still time for that
He will deliver it to us in Telecommunications Systems
Yes it's true
But if it is now that he is correcting the work on Systems and Signals, by Monday will he have corrected the work on Telecommunications Systems?
And he has to go do a random
Look at your logic kkk
He gave me 12
How is this possible
This is my question, you and I did everything the same
Calm down, he made a mistake in the calculations, it can only be
He already started it badly, and he still hasn't even gotten to Telecommunications Systems
Oh that's worse
I hope you thought in the next few, if he corrected them clear
there I'm really scared
To tell you the truth, I prefer to pass on Telecommunications Systems than Systems and Signals, because Systems and Signals is more relaxed
Yes boy, those stuff of telecommunications systems are more boring
boring is favor
But I've seen that we are fucked
You already know how it is, complicated... All that remains is to wait for the final sentence
I expect it to be fair
I really hope kkk
So he will put the grades until today
I'm really waiting here
Yet nothing
When he puts them, you send me a print because I'm without the internet
I'm here just seeing, this is only when he puts them, if he puts them
Boy, but that's abuse already
Worse is we expect so much and he gives us wrong results
This is even worse
The teacher is abused
you are watching
One day for the exam, and yet nothing of the guy
Has he already graded the other job?
I saw the conversation he said to Txoba
How much did he give you?
I've already given up waiting for anything in those subjects
If I'm going to do it next year, I'll do it there and that's final
Yes claro, I gave me 13 in this work
I had 11, and still he told me that I have exercises like other people and he does not tolerate it and that
But he's right, today I learned a few things
Seriously he told you that?
Maybe he corrected my work first, if he corrected yours first I would be the one to say these conversations
But patience now, I just want to see what he will say to others
And telecommunications systems he hasn't said nothing to us yet
If he follows with this logic, then we are lost
We are even fucked up
Did you subscribe to the exam?
How much did he give you for work on filtering?
I think we'll pass if he doesn't correct the tests
Oh boy, you could use the room email
I only use the school one
I wanted to send an email to Carla
We have to put pressure, the exam is tomorrow.
I thought it was today
Joana, go there and see, and you'll see that I'm right
The Systems and Signals exam is now day 3
Now that the teacher is putting the grades, you believe.
You didn't sign up for the exam?
No
I've moved into systems and signals, and you?
He still didn't give me my grade, I had 13
I just want to see telecommunications systems
For me that's what I'm most curious about.
Then it's gonna be shit...
One pain at a time
Maria, can I tell you something?
You know that girl I told you I was getting involved with her... she broke up with our stuff and that, because she's confused and all
so i.e. mural of history, i'm free
Get out, now nobody can stand you
I already had some things that I was saying no, but not now
This is the second time, I never really got involved, but to confess to you, there are some things I really like about her
But life is a breath and we are in summer kkk
Life is really a breath, how much did you have?
But Sónia we know that by parts he is right
he may have taken it off the grade, but I'm aware I didn't do much
but the staff soon come with ideas to call him
That's it, people think that just because he took so long, he has to be forced to give you the grade
I'm aware of what I did and it wasn't big things, and I know
I just did enough to get through, nothing else
The staff doesn't know how to behave, and then there's nothing to complain about because he graded all the works
See here the excuse of this guy
And now, did he do them correctly?
People don't know how to go to teachers
Strange Txoba did not appear with his things
He's silent, he still didn't say anything
And Rafa passed?
Now Txoba, I'm finding very strange yet he has not spoken
He also passed
Go see what he wrote in Classroom
And he said he has parts in my work that identifies with other works
Sonia in recent days I have learned some lessons
Next semester I won't go to school
I have not seen yet
Can you see there in my email, please?
I'm not with internet, and you had to give me your email, or this is written in my book
You can leave me already
He has already put the final grade, I'm already on vacation
This one that is the final grade
yes but in you he has not yet put
And I think here I had already failed
So I appeared, I was already worrying
But calm down what is yours is still saved
He already gave me
I had 13 values
You are great
And how much did you have?
At least we're safe this time
But I learned some things in these last days
We were quite fooled that he was not going to see the work
Not only that
I'm going to take another perspective, and with everyone
No longer has the delivery of my work ready for anyone
Who wants me to ask you some doubts and that or more, from there nothing more
I will no longer be a relief tabúa for anyone else
There is a point you are harming yourself
Exactly...
The conversations he told us ...
Not just that
I argue that if I didn't deliver my jobs to other people I could have much more
That
Like I spent my entire semester running back and forth. Killing myself there at school from morning to night and then send my report ready, for someone else to do his and still he does the same as mine
And then you are penalized
There are people who do not strive for anything, and want to find everything ready, and this is worth it for everyone
From the first year to us
No longer has facilities for anyone
Myself, there are people there in the room who never talked to me as it should be, but in the last works they sent me messages to send them things
And I don't even pay, but nothing from now
Enough, I have to stop these things is now
The only help that will leave me now are just opinions on how to do it for anyone, and nothing else
For me these conversations of the teacher hurt me a lot
In the fourth year each has to be able to see its fish
Yes, and then you are penalized and you take the same grade just like who copied in you
Really true
I think the people who moved just copying in the reports of others the conscience weighs them
I don't even want to know, I have nothing to do ...
Everything in life is to serve as a lesson, I already learned mine, it is up to each one to open their eyes
I have already learned, you are doing well. I was calling me in the email.
It was to ask about the subject that Paulo was saying, if you had even done him
Which one?
The one from there at school
I'm working on a company, so I didn't have time to go there
I was 1, 2 days, but then I couldn't go
Hmm ok, I also find myself working, and I was without a mobile phone so that I didn't tell you anything
What kind of work are you? Within our area?
I am just doing some cleaning work
I walk in one within the development area
Will you continue when we go to school?
Yes I work fixed
And when do you start going to school?
I have the idea to pass there on Monday, and you?
I don't know yet, I'm waiting to put the schedules
Yes, me too
I will be able to enroll and order the papers there
I also have to go and ask for them, as they take x time to deliver them
Yes, that's why I go there on Monday, and the registration closes on the 6th, after which it will open again
But this year they did the academic week very early
I found him for days, he said they are starting early to normalize the school year
We had a vacation later
But anyway, the staff will only show up there for the next week
This is the idea for me too, or when they put the schedules
This year we have a half strange time, in the morning and in the afternoon ...
Yes I am waiting for them to put the schedules
You are the first person I am talking about there is a few months old
Like this? Oh yes, I also said only with you
The living room staff only talk in times of Aulá
There are days when we have aulás in the morning, with the third year boys
I thought this year didn't have this story there ...
Yes, Sidney said to me ...
Notify me if they put the time please
YH is fine then, tomorrow will you go to school?
I have to go there
Tomorrow I will get the covid vaccine
I already took the two
I am able to go to school only on Wednesday I on Thursday
We see each other, you already know ...
If you have any discipline to make groups, you include me there please
You and you are always a group, you will not betray me this last year, not ...
of course...
How was today? No Aulás?
Very likely to be the same thing, but I have the idea to go.
Yh anything interesting you let me know
Now we have a good group, Txoba didn't like anything, nothing ...
He said we gave him a foot in the ass, kkk
But from the experience I had with him, for me is already good, he knows
But it is going slowly, because if not
I'm relaxed, there's nothing, really relaxed ...
Just do our work, we are more than relaxed
And how are we going to get the slides today?
what I really want to know, if we see him tomorrow we will say so
We have to do that 500 word thing
Good night, stay well
Yh until tomorrow
Tomorrow we talked then
I forgot that I have some updates for you, when we have to leave class I will tell you
This you are dedicating to me, it can only be kkkk
You are crazy kkk, you remembered me as soon as you see this meme
I remembered that if some other people understood programming, you could say that.
But it's not quite kkk, each with its own reasons
You know, or not ...
At least until it is to be
Next year you will remove this restriction
Then it's another subject, so far I'll be with a woman
Oh, it has to be
I said it like that, about what you already know
You remember Rosiane, she was cold with me, nor does he speak as more correctly
But you also had to explain very well
But I explained
I was uncomfortable, but I explained very well
poor her
Poor him
I can't, Sónia. She said a bucket of cold water
I can't, Sónia. He said a bucket of cold water
In fact, but better now than after
Truth
Because then it's worse, she surprised me
Because then it's worse, he surprised me
You know Dirce, she said she won't give up, I liked it, the way she extracted a good thing from a not so good situation
She said she won't give up, I liked it, the way she extracts a good thing from a not so good situation
Much interest involved
At least she did not use the cold water bucket to give up her goals
I already started to worry
It's still early to worry, boy
Tomorrow we talked about it
I have to think what I'm going to do with it
You need to digest this information
A friend of mine from Santo Antão who laid me this plague
I have to think well, because if I will not do a blunder
Nothing about that little girl, with someone else
Is missing only one of the work for terminal and we will be ready
Me and Rafa are shit
o de Reinforcement Learning
You will explain everything to me, for when the teacher asks
But at least this one is already
Roberto, I'm not able to put a sign "=" in Latex
latex? This time, boy?
If you have the work at Github, share it with me
For what latex of this hour?
But you are from the organization, so you can see
We have the private invitation, but you can see it
that I don't know why, tomorrow we will see him
I can go to school only after 12
It's already 10 hours
Now that we will reduce it
was helping Rafa bring his things
Share the doc with me, for me to go seeing it too
Already is, the doc is already shared with you
I will start you to do
Put the template you were and show me that hour
I'll put it, I'm just here to drink a tea first
And flirting !!
flirting, I never did it
read my messages there for you to see
I don't have time
Ok, we'll start putting our hands on work
Send me that Firewall thing please
Good morning, remember to go to school at 1 hour
This here we studied it after Navtex, or not?
I needed just gives aulá 5
Prepared? Of course not...
Now that I'm preparing kkkk
kkkkkk
Sónia ???
Do you know what Uncle Lau asked me today?
tell me, hurry up I'm curious
He said that since the second year, the two of us are very close, if you and I don't have anything else there...
Let me laugh devil ...
What did you answer him?
I told you that we are just friends and colleagues kkkk
What is his intention !!!
He just asked me, through a conversation about women we were having
Interesting
Sónia, you and I wouldn't work out, imagine hahaha
You already want to have control over me just like that
have control over you, devil
Yes, you don't see that kkk
Sorry ok, it is not my intention
You should tell Uncle Lau
Let me go lying down, that you don't ...
That was because he saw you wink at me, so
that thing went wrong, that's why I was trying to contact you
Rafa left you message that I had left you message?
I tried to contact it, but you don't return
It is because of writing errors, if you put them it will not accept them as valid
Let me run the script, and send you a picture of the error he gave
In the code, that error there did not occur to us
If you mark the date on the calendar, wait for me to confirm it
It's because he is not in the name for that, and also you had to delete the file .pdf
On the subject of the party, I told you that yesterday
That there I told Rafa to leave you message
And I gave you a touch but you didn't answer
I had a lot of ideas, but now I don't have any
You want to bet, that I will find one there at school
Because if it were, the code would not have errors, it would execute without problems
You want to bet, but I warn you that you will lose
Have you seen the binary files?
Have you seen the name of the files?
This mistake I already corrected it, now it is giving another
Now he's going on another return to finish completing
The script, what kind of error has given you now?
strange, because Rafa changed the same thing in the code, and it worked correctly
There at school you see you for me, if you get
Yes let's see the dogs yes, go as soon as you get
I think I've arrived in your error now
He is starting only a part of the machines
Yes you have to erase the lab.deb
I told you that, there in the room
The things that were to buy were written there in the notebook, but I already deleted them from there
Lunch will be delayed here at home, so we see that thing after the hole
Ok relaxed then
Give me your email pass so I can enter
You can leave it, I already managed to enter
I am here
I shared something with you, for your email
You have to register, put a photo and move on
Why do I need to do that?
You have already made all the files of the Intent
Not yet
I'm talking about the chatbot
Ah I thought you were talking about Jándir
I haven't done everything yet ...
I made some
That thing that Txoba gave us has only candidacies and bribes
Okay then, when you finish tell me
Will you be able to help me do Jándir's work, or not?
We have to mark a day
Can you go tomorrow after 3 hours?
Where is this place anyway?
Because if it's here, I have to go ask aunt first
There in place of that day
I don't know if this is how it is the name
Yes we can go there, and do our task there
At 3 am you can go? Because I think there closes at 6 am.
but take something done, so we can go any good tasks for doing
I already have some screens made, just need to implement the features
You can come here at home, you don't have to go in that place
I'm going out to go to the pier at 3 am
When you arrive in the square call me
I'm already here, where are you?
I'm just bored here, home, work
if I go on this vacation here, I will immediately go to see you
If you come I will see you, just you told me one day and I will go there
How many vacations have you promised me that? I don't know if I will believe this time
Naaa this time I will go kkk
I want to see if yes
Let me go to bed, be well
good at talking to you again
Owl
Ok, good night for you
Sleep well and dream with me
See a beautiful friend that I have !!!
Only in the photos kkkkk
I'm fine and you?
So yes
what are you doing?
I'm here relaxing a little, to go back to study again, and you?
I'm watching soap opera
very good
I would like to be watching a movie too
Oh with good mancarra kkk
Stay well, let me leave you, if you want we can mark a time tomorrow to talk better
So until tomorrow kisses
Ok, it can be the night around 8 am
be alright
It's always good to talk to you
owl
Good morning, how are you?
So is 8 hours still standing?
Yh kkkk
Good, so far then
keep me one earthnut
And how will you take it?
Wait you will know, how I will take it
You have already forgotten
I don't want to go, I'm very tired
Where is my earthnut?
I haven't bought it for you yet
You are late then
You are seeing what I wanted to say with it
yes, i hope you are not always late
what are you doing?
Am I helping a friend of mine to move home?
I'm here to program a little
And I will take my Mancarra in
Until tomorrow sleeps well
Did you keep that limp for me? Because when I go you will take him to me
When will you come?
Maybe soon this other week.
will you keep it for me?
clear kkkk
well I already have two, one in my mother and one in you lol
You are asking everyone for the mancarra
No, my mother already knows me, she knows that Mancarra and I have a longtime marriage and with a lot of love
You didn't invite me to this marriage to her
It was a long time since childhood
We still didn't even know
wait, how come you didn't know that I'm crazy in mancarra?
Only now that you are telling me
I'm sorry then, because I failed as a friend.
Almost everyone I know knows that.
Leave it from this, now I know
Take me with you
Come kkk
I'm already in Santo Antão
If you want to visit me any day going forward, just tell me
Tomorrow I will go to Puvação in the morning if you want we could meet there
And you will not come to see me
Yh, but I don't know when I can go
But if you can get down to Ribeira Grande we see out there
How many hours, if it was?
Like 9 or 10 hours, I will renew my health card
Ok, but how long will we stay together?
Like so far around 1 pm
Hi, how are you?
what kind of earthnut do you like?
Hi, how are you?
I like the little ones, those of the Pelito brand
I think this is how the brand is, why even ??
look, it's easier for you to message my number directly, because I answer right away
Look, come to see me or tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow or Saturday
I'll see if I can go to see you on Sunday
Because on other days I have work
how are you?
Also, what is done from you?
Nothing special just work, home
see a friend I have
Ugly, isn't it?
No, completely and contrary
How are you?
I'm fine, and you how are you?
Yh too
Are you sure you want to be just my friend?
why?
responds...
YH, do we have our friendship for a long time or not?
But why did you ask?
Because a photo like this makes me think otherwise
I have to play with you sometimes so I don't think I'm serious
relaxed, I know it's a joke
I know you are not serious
I am yes, you know
stop leaving me in lies, you and I are friends
Since you are my friend that I have to be realistic with you
what are you doing?
I was finishing a job, now I came here to talk to you
At least today you remembered me, ungrateful
No, I always remember you, you have abandoned me
no not me
I also always remember you, but you are not always online
yh true, but it's not to use it as an excuse
Look it's not an excuse, no
Congratulations my good
Many happiness, love, health, and that you will be able to achieve all the goals of your life
Continues this fun, friendly boy, this unique friend that you are
You already know, enjoy your day because you deserve
I'm watching television and you?
I will program kkk
How was your day today?
It was relaxed, normal, and yours how was it?
It was good
so yes
See you tomorrow
me too
Hey, how are you?
I left you a message, but then I saw that it wasn't necessary
I haven't seen him yet
Today I woke up with idea in you
So I woke up to talk to you right away, to see how you are?
I just know, yes
It is missing, it can only be
You and the studies?
are going, you already know how it works
Tell me more of you ...
a long time ago I didn't even see you
If so, I'll see you on the big holidays
It's been 3 years since I've been waiting for you
But this time I will see you
I told you that if you go I will kiss you your feet
So get ready for you to kiss my feet
I already told you no, that you will not go
Wait for you to see
I won't have problems kissing your feet if you go
but you also have to bring me a limp with you soon, for as long as I've been waiting for you
Of course I'll take the shirt, long ago I promised to give it to you
And you will save me a chocolate
I miss home a lot too
So we have a contract
Also for a long time that you have not come
I was there at the end of the year
But for a long time, I wasn't there
How are you?
good and you?
I'm lying down and you?
How's life going? You and the boys?
I do not have any
We are two, so
What are you doing?
I'm here doing a job
bored in Santo Antão, how is that even possible?
How are you?
Are we going to do a lot of scenes on this vacation?
clear. Just tell me when you will come
I already want to see you too
me too
I like our friendship in the same
So this is what matters
We have a lot to get ready
I'm just waiting for you, so we can go to do that thing
I hope this time is different
When will you come?
When I have a vacation, then I will already have a date
Only work, home
Today I don't want to leave
Not today
Something's missing?
You
Me, really?
So, I'm already on the way
I will be waiting for you
Until tomorrow, stay well
I'm tired, yes
I miss a massage to relax
Let me do it for you, to see how this one will be
I'm going
nothing special
You already know
How was your day today?
I saw my grandmother
And how it was?
I'm coming from school now
Did you have a good class?
Yes it was relaxed
I already want to have a vacation
When are you going to have a vacation?
But will you come soon to Ponta do Sol?
But will you come to Santo Antão soon?
I am still able to spend another time here
That's the way I like it
This time I will see you
I'm telling you that, because I will go there
I will be waiting
limp, now you hit me on the spot
Sorry
This is a friend of mine in his shit
He really liked you
You let him move your Facebook
No, he is that if he is not called, this was open on my computer
Are you together?
No, I'm here at school, so
What is your favorite color?
Black
Black has its place
Why did you ask me?
I'm thinking of going home in one of these days
prepare to receive me
I was finishing training now
I'm here for the work I came to do
Did you never tell me what you work for?
I do cashier in a store
When I go home I will see you
Promise is debt
what time do you leave work?
I leave at 8:30
Why didn't you tell me before? I was thinking of going to catch you.
If you were here, you would not say so
Wait until one day, and you will see
What are you going to do today?
I'm going out with a friend of mine
Are you at home?
Now enjoy me ...
You tell me to go see you but you are not at home
yes, it's just that I was up to something for that
what were you up to?
Yesterday I was there for your area ...
what were you doing there?
There was a party
It was just below
I'm relaxed at home
I walk without much desire to leave
But you should go out from time to time
Yes, I leave, only yesterday that I was not in much willing
Come to see me and I will go out with you
We combine better
When you are there, you tell me
Why, what do you have?
Yesterday they killed a friend of mine
But what happened?
I had already seen this news, but by the way...
Are these things there complicated?
I already want to see you
I also want to see you
Look, I'll get home this afternoon and return on Monday morning
If you want to go see me tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, you will be comfortable
Maybe I'll go Saturday to your area
Leave me a message if you will come or not
Didn't you come?
I already left, but I'm still in Ponta do Sol
I'm here underneath, but not even there
I thought you would go there
Is there with a lot of people?
No, I'm here on the riverside near there
But full of people, I don't think ... but there is some people
I'm going there, but just to buy something
You should stay around at the party
We are here relaxed
Will we be without seeing ourselves then?
Pitying
it's not my fault
Mine either
I will see if I can change the ticket for me to go on Wednesday
Valéria, come see me today
Today if I go around, I see if I can see you
If so, leave me mensage in my number
Because if we do not see us now, we will see ourselves only next year
I'm soft, I'm already here in São Vicente
Already?
Yes I arrived here on Monday
Of course, since yesterday I am enjoying
I'm in São Pedro
I'm coming home right now, I was walking a little
Not so, I am talking to you seriously
How did it go?
The tour was good
What did you do?
I just go out with my friends
I haven't heard from you for a long time, and those days I was always thinking about you
But I don't see you online
You can leave a message because later I'll see it
I have the chat disabled
And you, what is said about you?
You already know, how it is
You and this life? Tell me about you.
It's been a long time we haven't spoken very well
you too are making yourself ungrateful.
You have abandoned me
I never did it
I will never drop you
I know, because I'm your man
And you and this school?
But are you going to end, or not?
Yes, last year
You want to take evidence
And you no longer want to go to school?
Yes, I want
I'm waiting for my sister to tell me if I'm going to school next year or not
Because it is she who is paying my school
I thought you would come this year, I already had some ideas
