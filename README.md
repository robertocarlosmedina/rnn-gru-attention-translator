# GRU-Gated Attention Model Implementation for Machine Translation (MT)
### _Machine Translation (MT) system to carry out translations from Cape Verdean Creole to English and vice versa_

The model was proposed by [Zhang et al. (2019)] and achieve great results in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as MT.

> This project was made with the intention of being an integral part of my final final project.
> All aspects addressed in the implementation were made according to the needs of the project as a whole.
> Cape Verdean Creole is the mother language of Cape Verde, which is not an official language and is not well represented and known around the world. Therefore, it is a great honor to carry out studies and projects that contribute to its recognition and dissemination.


### Features

This implementation provides some features that can be accessed by commands in the terminal. Some of the features are:

- Train and test the translation models;
- Calculate the evaluation metrics (BLUE, METEOR and TER);
- Calculate the model parameter numbers;
- Test of translation by the terminals;
- Confusion confusion matrix generator.


### Dependencies

To run this project there are some python dependencies/libraries that need to be installed.
To perform this installation run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Execution
To execute this project you should pick one the commands according te task you want to make. The commads are:
- **console** - to open a test simulator for MT in the terminal;
- **train** - to train a model;
- **test_model** - to open a test console of a few sentences of the test data;
- **blue_score** - to calculate the BLUE score according to the test data;
- **meteor_score** - to calculate the METEOR score according to the test data;
- **ter_score** - to calculate the BLUE score according to the test data;
- **confusion_matrix** - to generate a confusion matrix according to the given sentence;
- **count_parameters** - to count the number of model parameters.

Then it is necessary to specify the source and target language, for example, being English (**en**) as source and Cape Verdean Creole (**cv**) as target language, the complete command to execute a training would be:
```sh
python main.py -a train -s en -t cv
```
**Notes** that the parameters have the following meanings:
- **'-a'** or **'--action'** is the action to be performed;
- **'-s'** or **'--source'** is the source language;
- **'-t'** or **'--target'** is the target language;


### All parts of the project into a whole
The whole project is divided into parts and each part has an essential function in it.
They are distributed as shown in the subtopics below.


#### Models implementation
This are the model used in the whole project:

- [Transformer model implementation]
- [GRU model implementation]
- [LSTM model implementation]
- [Models Training Graphs Generator]


#### Frontend test platform
This is a React App made to test all the translations made by the models, similar to the App [Google Translator]. 
Projects related to using the frontend application can be found at:

- [MT Models API implementation]
- [Cape Verdean Creole Translator Frontend test App]


#### Dataset
The dataset used to train, validate and test the model was the [CrioleSet dataset].
If the dataset is not in the project while executing any of the action commands, it will be downloaded and added to the project.

- [CrioleSet dataset]
